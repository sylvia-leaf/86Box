PIO VS dma

driver is DIRECTLY modifying pfifo 

8X8 channel setup

Names are 32-bit integers >4096

RAMFC - DMA Context object 0,0 to 8,8 

context = channel, render object, object type, offset in instance memory

for a rectangle (type 0x47), object render = 1, channel 0, at 0x0400 in the ramht memory

=0x00c70400 as the context

the ramht hash :

xor every byte of the hash individually and then xor that with the channel number

so obj id 01020304 in channel 0 is 1 xor 2 xor 3 xor 4 xor 0

Store in RAMHT at <subchannel start within RAMHT> + 4*16 = name
Store in RAMHT at <subchannel start within RAMHT> + 4*16 + 4 = context

then the ramin stuff starts at *0xc04000 since c00000 is the start of ramin [PCI BAR1] which is where you put the contents of the class struct

nv_user

Consider the 8x8 channels as 64 subchannels.
Now you can do:

They seem to end at 0x880000

(0x880000)/64 = 0x2000 for each channel

FAILURE -> RAMRO!
